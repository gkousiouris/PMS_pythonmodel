# PMS_pythonmodel

The aim of this excercise is to observe the creation of a simplistic model for predicting the response time of a server, after training with different numbers of server replicas deployed and according number of users.

To run the excercise, you need to launch a container from dockerhub:
`docker run -it -p 9050:8888 --name model  kubeflownotebookswg/jupyter-tensorflow-full:v1.9.2`

Then you need to access the `<container_node>:9050` UI in your browser.


Once inside you can clone this repository and have the files locally available or donwload manually from this repo the files and upload them through the Notebook UI.
